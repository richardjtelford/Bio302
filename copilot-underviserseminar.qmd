## Bio300B

Master-level introduction to biostatistics with R

-   Data processing

-   Data visualisation

-   Descriptive statistics to generalised linear model and mixed effect models

-   Students have wide range of statistical and coding experience

-   Assessed by portfolio of five assignments

## One approach to LLMs

```{r}
#| label: UiA
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("figs/Screenshot from 2025-01-27 20-37-23.png")
```

## An alternative approach

::::: columns
::: column
AI is coming

-   Students will use AI (and you cannot prove it)

-   Competitors for jobs are using AI

Students need to be able to use AI effectively


Teach to solve problems, not to write code

## Tradition help for coding 

-   Function documentation (help files)

-   Vignettes

-   [Stackoverflow.org](Stackoverflow.org)

-   Course material

-   Ask TA for help
- Ask peers for help

## AI tools to help coding

### ChatBots

-   [chat-GPT](https://chat-gpt.com/)

-   [phind](https://phind.com/)

### Integrated

-   [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)\
    Works with VSCode and RStudio\
    Requires GitHub account\
    Free with educational license [https://github.com/education](https://github.com/education)
    

## Use of AI in coding

- explain errors
- explain code
- suggest code

Copilot uses context (including comments) to suggest code

Works with any language

## Problems with AI

- AI doesn't understand the problem
- Imagines functions that don't exist
- Suggests old solutions
- Generate nonsense code
- Can promote poor coding practice

## Potential

- Let AI take care of the syntax so students can focus on problem solving
- Help students get started
- Help overcome challenges (unhelpful error messages, difficult documentation)

## Challenges

Will AI limit learning?

## Assessment and LLM

-   Cannot prevent students using LLMs in assessments without returning to timed, proctored exams

-   Timed, proctored exams don't test the learning outcomes we are interested in

- Need to make assessments that are non-trivial for LLMs to solve

  - Open-ended tasks
  - Tasks that require understanding of the data and the problem
  - Real datasets

## Students own their code

"Copilot made me do it" is not an excuse for code failing.

Students reponsible for verifying that AI code works as expected.

## Setting up copilot in RStudio

1) Make a github account [github.com](https://github.com)
2) Get an educational license [github.com/education](https://github.com/education) (free)
3) In RStudio, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Copilot -> Enable copilot
4) Press <kbd>tab</kbd> to accept CoPilot suggestions
5) Use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> to see RStudio autocomplete suggestions
