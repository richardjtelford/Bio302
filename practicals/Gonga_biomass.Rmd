Task: Biomass data

Plant Biomass data for alpine grasslands on Gongga Mountain, China, are archived at https://osf.io/6sfqw/ 

There are four sites, each with about 20 plots.
For each species in each plot, the following are recorded:

- height up to ten times (H1-H10)
- Biomass (labelled production)
- Cover

Find the total biomass per plot, and present the results in a figure.

As far as possible, follow best practice when running the analysis.
