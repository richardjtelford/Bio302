Exercises 

1) Import data LME.csv <br>
id gives the group id, y is the response, ab and AB are predictors

2) What is a random effect?

3) What is a fixed effect?

4) Fit an appropriate a model with y and AB

5) Interpret the results

6) Fit an appropriate a model with y and ab

7) Interpret the results

8) Include both AB and ab as predictors and do a backward elimination

9) What type of contrast is used?

10) What is the expected mean for the different levels of AB and ab?

11) Use a linear model with AB and compare the results to question 4

12) Use a linear model with ab and compare the results to question 6

15) Import data length.csv <br>
id is the individual id, day is the predictor, length is the response

16) Find the best model to explain the data
