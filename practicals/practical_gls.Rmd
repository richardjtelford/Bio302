## GLS

With the built-in `iris` data.

Make a plot to show how `Petal.Length` varies between species.

Find the variance of `Petal.Length` for each species.

Fit an anova using `lm` between `Petal.Length` and species and examine the diagnostic plots.

Fit a `gls` for the same model. Have the coefficients changed? (remember to load ´nlme´ package)

Fit a `gls` for the same model but allow the variance to be different for each species by adding `varIdent` to the `weights` argument of the model. 

Use `AIC` to test if this is a better model.
