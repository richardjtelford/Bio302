# Recording the history of your projects

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.


## Question?

<br>

How do you record the history of your projects?

## Better - Saving everything together at once

Every time you make a save, you zip the entire directory that your project files are in and save it with a date.

## How does a version control system work?

## 

- Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save just
the changes you made at each step of the way.

- You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

## 

- You can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.

# Why use Git and GitHub

## Why use Git?

- Makes you fearless
- Easy to set up
- Allows you to take a snapshot of every stage of your project history
- Takes up minimal space
- Creates a easy navigable map to the history of all changes made
- Distributed - can work offline

## Features of using a Hosting Service Like Github

- Backup of your project
- No need for a server: easy to set up
- GitHub's strong community: your colleagues are probably already there
- Provides tools to help enhance collaboration
- A common location to share off your work
- Free public repositories
- Free private repositories
