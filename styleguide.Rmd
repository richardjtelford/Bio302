## Why

 - Makes code easier to read
 - Makes code easier to debug

Make your own style - but be consistent

## Naming Things

>    “There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.”

>    — Phil Karlton

## Naming Objects

 - Names can contain letter numbers "_"" and "."
 - Names must begin with a letter or "."
 - Avoid using names of existing functions - confusing
 - Make names concise yet meaningful
 - Reserved words include TRUE, for, if
 
## Which of these are valid names?

 - min_height
 - max.height 
 - _age 
 - .mass 
 - MaxLength 
 - min-length 
 - FALSE
 - 2widths 
 - celsius2kelvin 
 - plot

 
## Spacing

White-space is free! 

Makes code more readable

Place spaces around all infix operators (`%>%`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, (but not `:` or `::` )) and around `=` in function calls. 

Always put a space after a comma, and never before.

### Good
```{r, eval = FALSE}
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)
ChickWeight[1, ]
```
### Bad
```{r, eval = FALSE}
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
ChickWeight[1,]
```

## Split long commands over multiple lines

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list(
  total = a + b + c, 
  mean  = (a + b + c) / n
)
```

## Indentation makes code more readable

### Good
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pos <- function(x) {
  if (is.null(dim(x))) {
    x[x > 0]
  } else{
    x[, colSums(x) > 0, drop  = FALSE]
  }
}
```

### Bad
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pos <- function(x){
if(is.null(dim(x)))
{x[x >0]} 
else{
x[, colSums(x) > 0, drop  = FALSE]
}}
```

## Assignment

Use <-, not =, for assignment.

### Good
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 5
```
### Bad
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x = 5
```

## Comments

Use # to start comments.

Help you and others to understand what you did

Comments should explain the why, not the what.

Use comments to break up file into readable chunks for navigation
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#### Load data ####
...
#### Plot data ####
...
```
 
## Split analyses over multiple files

Long scripts become difficult to navigate

Fix by moving parts of the code into different files

For example: 

 - data import code to "loadData.R"
 - functions to "functions.R"

Import with  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("loadData.R")
source("functions.R")
```
 
## Don't repeat yourself

Repeated code is hard to maintain

Make repeated code into functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_fun <- function(arg1) {arg1 ^ 2}
my_fun(7)
```
Single place to maintain

Reuse ggplot objects or entire plots

```{r, eval = FALSE}
th <- theme(legend.position = "bottom")
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length, colour = Species))  +
  geom_point() +
  th
```


 
## Avoid `attach()`

Unless you like strange bugs

Very rarely useful to attach - many better options

## Exercise

Take some of your existing R code and reformat it according to these style guides. 

Check your code still works!
