```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

## Why

A good IDE makes R coding more efficient and reduces some types of bugs

 - Bracket matching
 - Autocomplete of function/variable names
 - Integrated help
 - Project management and version control
 - Help debugging
 - integration with Rmarkdown

## Choices

 - Tinn-R (Windows only)
 - RKWard
 - emacs
 - __RStudio__ [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com)

## Demonstration

 - Autocompletion
 - Bracket matching
 - Code formatting
 - alt-shift-k to get shortcuts
 
## Project management

Use Rstudio projects for project management

 - Keeps related files together
 - Keeps track of working directory, history and environment
 - Integration with version control
 
## Use relative paths 

`read_table("data/myfile.txt")` # good

`read_table("c:/projects/myProject/mysubproject/mysubsubsubproject/myfolderwithaverylongname/data/myfile.txt")` # bad
 
Or better use `here` package

```{r}
library(here)
read_table(here("data/myfile.txt"))
```
 
## Setting R-studio up

Don't save/restore workspace

`Tools >> Global Options >> General`

 - `Save workspace to .Rdata on exit -> Never`
 - `Restore .Rdata into workspace on startup -> OFF`

Word-wrap 

`Tools >> Global Options >> Code >> soft-wrap R source files`


 
## Exercise

Set up an Rstudio project called Bio302

We will use this project all week.

Open a new script and start to __type__ some code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
set.seed(42) # make reproducible
df <- tibble(#a tibble is a better data.frame - compare
  x = 1:10,
  y = rnorm(10)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Become familiar with the autocomplete, sending code to the console and some shortcuts
